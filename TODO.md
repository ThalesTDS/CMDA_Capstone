### **Comment Density**
- Ignore `from` and `import` statements when calculating comment density.
- Only count inline comments for comment density.
- Exclude class and method declarations from the calculation to separate the metric from completeness.

### **Conciseness**
- Appears to be working well but requires further testing.

### **General**
- Create/Find sample code to run tests on.
- Adjust weighting of metrics.
